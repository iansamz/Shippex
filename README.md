# Welcome to Shippex Demo App ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).


## Overview

This project is a demo application for tracking shipments, built using Expo and React Native. It leverages Redux for state management and TypeScript for static type checking. The project aims to replicate the design specified in the Shippex Design.

## Utilities

Tools used by this repo:
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) for building cross-platform mobile applications.
- [Expo](https://expo.dev) for building and deploying React Native applications easily.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management and data fetching with RTK Query
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) for pre-commit linting
  
## How To Run

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
